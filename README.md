## What is LifeFit

LifeFit is a Python package to analyze **time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC)** data sets, namely **fluorescence lifetime** and **time-resolve anisotropy** decays. 

LifeFit has been developed by Fabio Steffen in the lab of [Prof. Roland Sigel](https://www.chem.uzh.ch/en/sigel/) at the University of Zurich.
